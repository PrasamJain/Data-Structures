********   Singly Linked List      **********


 * The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list. 
 * Each element in the singly linked list is called a node. 
 * Each node has two components: data and a pointer next which points to the next node in the list. 
 * The first node of the list is called as head, and the last node of the list is called a tail. The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null. 
 * Each node in the list can be accessed linearly by traversing through the list from head to tail.


OPERATIONS ON SINGLY LINKED LIST........
________________________________________

* Traversal - access each element of the linked list.

* Insertion - adds a new element to the linked list.

* Deletion - removes the existing elements.

* Searching - find a node in the linked list.

* Sorting - sort the nodes of the linked list.

* Display list - Printing all the elements.

* Update - change the value of any node.

* Reverse the list - Reverse all the node by reversing pointer to the node.
