# DATA STRUCTURE & ALGORITHM

Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.
Data-Structure can be used to store and organize data where as Algorithms is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem set.


Data-Structure can be divided into two parts - 

	Linear Data-Structure
	Non-Linear Data-Structure
	
	
Linear Data-Structure is used to store data in the form of:

	Array
	Linked List
	Stack
	Queue


Non-Linear Data-Structure is used to store data in the form of:

	Tree
	Graph
	
	
Various Algorithm Techniques are used to solve problems like:

	Greedy approches
	Dynamic Programming
